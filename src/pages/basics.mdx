# Basics

In this lesson, we will cover the basics of data types and variables.


<Heading level={2} id="constants" />
## Literal Constants {{ anchor: false }}

literal constants are values written directly into your code.
They can be one of several different data types: `int`, `float`, and `str`.

<CodeGroup >

```python {{ title: 'int'}}
# An integer is a whole number
1 
1245
-500
```


```python {{ title: 'float'}}
# A floating point number has a decimal value
1.5
1500.5
-1.0
```

```python {{ title: 'str'}}
# A string is a sequence of characters.
# You can specify a string with quotes
"Hello"
"this is a string"
'Single quotes work too'
```

</CodeGroup >

<Heading level={2} id="printing" />
## Printing {{ anchor: false }}

The `print` function is used to display text output from code.
It takes a single argument as input, which can be any of the literal constants
we just learned about.

```python
print("This is how you print")
print("I can print more with another print call")
```

<Heading level={2} id="comments" />
## Comments {{ anchor: false }}
Comments are text inside your code that does not run. These are used for 
documenting your code, taking notes, and 
preventing certain sections of your code from running. In Python, a comment
starts with the `#` character. 

```python
# This is a comment
print("hi") # this is also a comment
```


### Exercise
Use the print function to print the following values: `123`, `1.234`, `Hello, World!`.
You can do this with 3 separate print calls, each on a new line.

<PyEditor
  title='Print exercise'
  defaultCode="# This is your first editor
    # type your code below
    # press the play button to run your code"
  validation = {`
status = {"done": False, "message": "Nice Job!"}
if not "123\\n" in _output:
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, did you print 123?'
elif not "1.234\\n" in _output:
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, did you print 1.234?'
elif not "Hello, World!\\n" in _output:
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, did you print "Hello, World!"?'
else:
  status["done"] = True
status
`}

checkCode = { (code) => {
  if (code.includes("print('123')") || code.includes('print("123")')) {
      return "That's almost right! But try printing 123 without quotes"
  }
  if (code.includes("print('1.234')") || code.includes('print("1.234")')) {
      return "That's almost right! But try printing 1.234 without quotes"
  }
}}
/>



### Exercise 

Try using comments to prevent the print function from running in the first two lines.

<PyEditor
  title='Comment exercise'
  defaultCode='print("comment this line out")
print("also comment this line out")
print("print this line")'
  validation = {`
status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice Job!"}
if not ["print this line\\n"] == _output:
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, you printed something unexpected'
  status["done"] = False
status
`}

checkCode = { (code) => {  
  if (!code.includes("print(\"comment this line out\")") || !code.includes('print(\"also comment this line out\")')) {
      return "hmm, looks like you deleted some lines instead of commenting them out"
  }
}}
/>


<Heading level={2} id="variables" />
## Variables {{ anchor: false }}

Variables are used to store values like the literal constants we learned about earlier.

```python
whole_number = 25
number_with_decimal = 1.245
say_hello = "Hello, World!"
five = 5
one_half = 0.5
message = "This is a message"
number_1 = 1
```

Variables are created by assigning a value to a name.
This can be any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores,
but the first character cannot be a number. The standard naming convention is to use
lowercase letters and underscores to separate words. For example, `my_variable_name`.

Printing a variable is like printing a literal constant, except you use the variable name instead.
You can print multiple variables by separating them with commas.


```python
my_variable = 123
another_variable = "hello"
print("This is my variable:", my_variable)
# This is my variable: 123
print("and this is another variable:", another_variable)
# and this is another variable: hello
```

Variables can also be reassigned to a new value.

```python
my_name = 'John'
my_name = 'Jane'
```

Variables are loosely typed, meaning Python will automatically determine the type of the
variable based on the value you assign to it. This means you could have a variable that is a
string one moment, and an integer the next.

```python
my_variable = "One Two Three"
my_variable = 123
```

 

### Exercise

Create a variable with an integer value, a variable with a float value, and a variable with a string value. 
Print all three on a single line. Additionally, reassign the variable `existing_variable` to a new value.


<PyEditor
  title='Variables exercise'
  defaultCode='print(existing_variable)'
  preRunCode = {`
existing_variable = "This is the original value"
_pre_globals = set(globals())
`}
  validation = {`
status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice Job!"}
_post_globals = set(globals())
_new_globals = _post_globals - _pre_globals
global_types = [type(globals()[g]) for g in _new_globals]

if not int in global_types:
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, did you create an integer variable?'
  status["done"] = False
elif not float in global_types:
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, did you create a float variable?'
  status["done"] = False
elif not str in global_types:
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, did you create a string variable?'
  status["done"] = False

if existing_variable == "This is the original value":
  status["message"] = 'hmmm, did you reassign the existing variable?'
  status["done"] = False

status
`}
checkCode = { (code) => {}}
/>


<Heading level={2} id="print_formatting" />
## Print Formatting {{ anchor: false }}

An f-string is a way to format a string with variables, this can be useful when printing a message in a specific format.

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

You can also add formatting to the variables.

```python
pi = 3.14159265359
print(f"pi is {pi:.2f}")
# pi is 3.14
```



<Heading level={2} id="input" />
## User Input {{ anchor: false }}


The `input` function is used to get input from the user. Normally this would be through the command line,
but for this course, it will be through a popup text box. The `input` function produces a string from the user input.
You can also include a prompt message to display to the user.

```python
query = input("hello, how are you today? ")
```

###  Exercise

Using the `input` function, prompt the user for their name and store it in the variable `name`.

<PyEditor
  title='Input exercise'
  defaultCode=''
  preRunCode = {``}
  validation = {`
status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice Job!"}
if not 'name' in globals():
  status["message"] = "hmmm, did create a name variable?"
  status["done"] = False
elif not isinstance(name, str):
  status["message"] = "hmmm, did you assign a string to the name variable?"
  status["done"] = False
else: 
  status = {"done": True, "message": f"Nice Job, {name}! I hope you are enjoying the course so far."}
status
`}

checkCode = { (code) => {
  if (!code.includes("input\(")) {
      return "hmm, did you use the input function?"
  }
}}
/>
