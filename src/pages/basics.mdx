# Basics

A literal constant can be one of several different data
types: `int`, `float`, and `str`. You can print constants
and you can sign them to variables. They should be named a
certain way. Certain data types can be converted between
each other. They can also be printed out in specific ways

- Why do different data types exist?

## Literal Constants {{ anchor: false }}

A literal constant can be one of several different data
types: `int`, `float`, and `str`.

<CodeGroup >

```python {{ title: 'int'}}
# An integer is a whole number
1 
1245
-500
```

```python {{ title: 'float'}}
# A floating point number has a decimal value
1.5
1500.5
-1.0
```

```python {{ title: 'str'}}
# A string is a sequence of characters.
# You can specify a string with quotes
"Hello"
"this is a string"
'Single quotes work too'
```

<Heading level={2} id="printing" />
## Printing {{ anchor: false }}

The `print` function is used to display output text from your program.
We will cover functions more in another lesson, 

```python
print("This is how you print")
print("I can print more with another print call")
```

### Exercise
Use the print function to print the following values: `123`, `1.234`, `Hello, World!`.
You can do this with 3 separate print calls, each on it's own line.
{/* <Note>
This will be 3 separate print calls
</Note> */}



<PyEditor
  title='hello'
  defaultCode="# This is your first editor type your code below
    # press the play button to run your code"
/>







```python {{ title: 'Print exercise'}}
# This is your first editor type your code below
# press the play button to run your code
```

<Heading level={2} id="comments" />
## Comments {{ anchor: false }}

Comments are text inside your code that does not execute. 
You have already seen some comments above. These are used for 
documenting what your code is doing, taking notes for yourself, and 
preventing certain sections of your code from running. In Python a comment
starts with the `#` character. 

You can also comment out the currently selected
lines with the editor shortcut: <Hotkey/> + `/` 

```python
# This is comment
print("hi") # this is also a comment
```


**Exercise:** Comment out the lines according to their string values 


```python {{ title: 'Comment exercise'}}
print("comment this line out")
print("also comment this line out")
print("print this line")
```

```python
import asyncio

while(True):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('tick')
```


<PyEditor defaultCode={`print('test')`}/>
