# Control Flow

We can use control flow statements to change the execution of a program based on certain conditions, such as the value of a variable.

<Heading level={2} id="booleans" />
## Booleans and Comparison {{ anchor: false }}

A Boolean is another data type in Python. It can have one of two values: `True` or `False`.
They can be a literal constant or the result of a comparison operator.

```python
is_true = True
is_false = False
```

We can use a set of operators to compare two values and output a Boolean value.
These operators include:

- `>` greater than,
- `<` less than,
- `>=` greater than or equal to,
- `<=` less than or equal to,
- `==` equal to,
- `!=` not equal to.

Here are some examples of comparison operators in action:

<CodeGroup >
```python {{ title: 'Greater'}}
# Greater than
4 > 3 # True
10 > 10 # False

# Greater than or equal to

4 >= 3 # True
10 >= 10 # True

````

```python {{ title: 'Less'}}
# Less than
4 < 4 # False
3 < 4 # True

# Less than or equal to
4 <= 4 # True
3 <= 4 # True
````

```python {{ title: 'Equal' }}
# Equal to
4 == 4 # True
3 == 4 # False

# Not equal to
4 != 4 # False
3 != 4 # True
```

</CodeGroup >

<Heading level={2} id="if" />
## If Statements {{ anchor: false }}

An `if` statement executes a block of code if given a boolean expression that evaluates to `True`.

```python
if True:
    print('It is true!')
```

Indentation is used to define the scope of the `if` statement.
A code block must be indented by the same amount, but the amount of indentation is up to you.

```python
if True:
    # This is a code block
    print('this will print')
    print('this will also print')
    # This is the end of the code block

if False:
    # This code block will not be executed
    print('this will not print')
    print('this will not print either')

if x == 10:
    # This code block will be executed if x is equal to 10
    print('this might print')
```

You can even nest `if` statements inside of each other.

```python
if True:
    print('this will print')
    if False:
        # this is a nested code block
        print('this will not print')
    print('this will also print')
```


### Exercise

Provide a value for `x` such that only the last `print` statement is executed.

<PyEditor
  title='if exercise'
  defaultCode={`x = # put value here

if x > 6:
    print('x is greater than 6')

if x < 6:
    print('x is less than 6')
    
if x >= 6:
    print('x is greater than or equal to 6')`}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}
    if not 'x is greater than or equal to 6\\n' in _output:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "Try again!"
    status

`}

/>




<Heading level={2} id="else" />
## Else and Else If {{ anchor: false }}

An `if` statement can also be extended by adding an `else` statement.

```python
x = 6
if x > 7:
    print('x is greater than 7')
else:
    print('x is less than 7')
```

In the example above, the `else` statement is only executed if the `if` statement's expression
evaluates to `False`.

Additionally, you can add an `elif` statement to extend an `if` statement further.
An `elif` is short for "else if" and is used to check for additional conditions. You can
have as many `elif` statements as you want. The statements are evaluated from top to bottom,
and the first one that evaluates to `True` is executed.

```python
x = 6
if x > 7:
    print('x is greater than 7')
elif x > 5:
    print('x is greater than 5')
else:
    print('x is less than 5')
```

In the example above, the `elif` statement only tries to run
if the initial `if` statement evaluates to `False`.

You need to be careful when ordering your `elif` statements, or this could result in unreachable code.

```python
x = 6
if x > 5:
    print('x is greater than 5')
elif x > 7:
    # this code will never run
    print('x is greater than 7')
else:
    print('x is less than 5')
```

### Exercise

Given a number `x` print out the following:
1. If `x` is positive, print out `x is positive`.
2. If `x` is negative, print out `x is negative`.
3. If `x` is 0, print out `x is 0`.

<PyEditor
  title='if, elif, and else exercise'
  defaultCode="# Try running multiple times to see different results
    print(x)"
  preRunCode = {`
import random
x = random.randint(-1, 1)
_xV = x
`}
  preValidation = {[
    `x = 1; _message = "x is positive\\n"; _fail = "hmm, not quite for positive numbers"`,
    `x = -1; _message = "x is negative\\n"; _fail = "hmm, not quite for negative numbers"`,
    `x = 0; _message = "x is 0\\n"; _fail = "hmm, not quite for when x is 0"`
  ]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": False, "message": _fail}

    print("**", _message, _output)
    if _message in _output:
        status['done'] = True
        status['message'] = "Nice job!"
    status
`}
/>

<Heading level={2} id="while" />
## While loops {{ anchor: false }}

A `while` statement is similar to an if statement. However, a `while` statement will
continue to execute its code block as long as the expression evaluates to `True`.


```python
while True:
    print("This will print over and over again")
```

It's important to be careful when writing `while` loops.
If the expression never evaluates to `False`, the loop will never terminate
and the program will not end.



Using a variable to control the number of times a loop executes is a common pattern.

```python
times = 3
while times > 0:
    print("This will print 3 times")
    times -= 1
```
In the example above, the `times` variable is 3. On each iteration of the loop the
value is reduced by 1. Once the value of `times` is 0 the expression no longer evaluates to `True`.

### Exercise

Write a `while` loop that prints out the numbers 0 to 9.

<Note>
  You may need to reload this page if you accidentally write an infinite loop.
</Note>

<PyEditor
  title='while loop exercise'
  defaultCode={``}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}
    check_vals = [str(i) + '\\n' for i in range(10)]

    for val in check_vals:
        if not val in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Try again!"
            break

    if '10\\n' in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Hmm, you're printing 10. Try again!"
    status

`}
/>

<Heading level={2} id="for" />
## For loops {{ anchor: false }}

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a string, tuple, list, or dictionary
(which we will learn about later). For now, we will use the range function to create loops
that execute a specific number of times.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print("This will print 3 times")
```
In the example above, the `range` function creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 2.
On each iteration of the loop, the next value in the sequence is assigned to the variable `i`.


### Exercise

Write a `for` loop that prints out the numbers 0 to 9.

<PyEditor
  title='for loop exercise'
  defaultCode={``}

  
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}
    check_vals = [str(i) + '\\n' for i in range(10)]

    for val in check_vals:
        if not val in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Try again!"
            break

    if '10\\n' in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Hmm, you're printing 10. Try again!"
    status

`}
/>

<Heading level={2} id="break-continue" />
## Break and Continue {{ anchor: false }}

`break` and `continue` can be used in `while` and `for` loops
to alter their behavior.

A `break` statement will immediately exit the loop.

```python
while True:
    print("This will only print once")
    break
```

A `continue` statement starts the next iteration of the loop
and skips the rest of the code block.

```python
while True:
    print("This will print over and over again")
    continue
    print("This will never print")
```

`break` and `continue` are often used in conjunction with `if` statements.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

The example above will print out the odd numbers from 1 to 9.
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code block when `i` is even.


### Exercise

Given a number `x`, use `continue` to print out even numbers from 0 to `x`. Use `break` Stop if you reach a number greater than 20.

<PyEditor
  title='Break and continue exercise'
  defaultCode="# Try running multiple times to see different results
    print('x is', x)"
  preRunCode = {`
    import random
    x = random.randint(10, 30)
    _xV = x
    `}
  preValidation = {[ `x = 10`, `x = 17`,`x = 50`]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}
    check_vals = [str(i) + '\\n' for i in range(0,x+1,2) if i <= 20]

    if '1\\n' in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Hmm, you printed an odd number. Try again!"

    for val in check_vals:
        if not val in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Try again!"
            break

    too_far = x + 1
    if x % 2 == 1:
        x += 1

    if f'{too_far}\\n' in _output:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "Hmm, you printed too many numbers. Try again!"


    if '22\\n' in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Hmm, you printed a number greater than 20. Try again!"
    status

`}
checkCode = { (code) => {
  if (!code.includes("break") || !code.includes("continue")) {
      return "That's right, but you didn't use both `break` and `continue`."
  }
}}
/>





<Heading level={2} id="none" />
## None{{ anchor: false }}

`None` is a value that represents the absence of a value.
It is often used with if statements to check if a variable has a value.

```python
x = None
if x is None:
    x = "Default value"
```
In the example above, we check if `x` is `None` before
assigning a value to it. This is most useful when the value of the variable
is not known until later in the program.

```python
message = None
if y == 1:
    message = "y is 1"
elif y == 2:
    message = "y is 2"
if message:
    print(x)
```
In the example above, we assign `message` a value based on the value of `y`.
Then check if `message` has a value before printing it out.




### Exercise

Given the variables `x`,`y`, and `z`, print the sum of the values that are not `None`.
<PyEditor
  title='None exercise'
  defaultCode="# Try running multiple times to see different results
    print(x, y, z)"
  preRunCode = {`
    import random
    values = random.randint(0, 30)
    if values < 5:
        x = None
        y = None
        z = random.randint(10, 30)
    elif values < 10:
        x = random.randint(10, 30)
        y = None
        z = random.randint(10, 30)
    elif values < 20:
        x = None
        y = random.randint(10, 30)
        z = random.randint(10, 30)
    else:
        x = random.randint(10, 30)
        y = random.randint(10, 30)
        z = random.randint(10, 30)
    `}
  preValidation = {[ `x,y,z = None,10,12`, `x,y,z = None,None,9`, `x,y,z = 7,8,9`]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}
  
    _total = 0 
    if x:
        _total += x
    if y:
        _total += y
    if z:    
        _total += z

    if not f'{_total}\\n' in _output:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "HmmTry again!"

    status

`}
/>

<Heading level={2} id="logical" />
## Boolean Operations {{ anchor: false }}

Boolean operations are used to make more complex boolean expressions. 

```python
if x > 0 and y > 0:
    print("Both x and y are positive")
```

In the example above, 
we use the `and` operator to check if both `x` and `y` are positive. 
You could achieve the same result with two `if` statements, but
this is an example of how boolean operations can make your code more concise.

```python
if x > 0:
    if y > 0:
        print("Both x and y are positive")
```

There are three boolean operations:

1. `and` - Returns True if both the operands are True, False otherwise.
```python
print(True and True) # True
```
2. `or` - Returns True if any of the operands are True, False otherwise.
```python
print(True or False) # True
```

3. `not` - Returns True if the operand is False, False otherwise.
```python
print(not True) # False
```

### Exercise

Given the variables `x`,`y`, and `z` print the following:

1. if `x` and `y` are greater than `10`, print `step 1 is True`
2. if `z` or `y` is greater than `x`, print `step 2 is True`
3. if step 2 is `False`, print `step 2 is False`

<PyEditor
  title='Boolean operations exercise'
  defaultCode="# Try running multiple times to see different results

  preValidation = {[`x,y,z = 11,11,0`, `x,y,z = 1,0,10`,`x,y,z = 1,10,10`,`x,y,z = 11,11,0`,`x,y,z = 9,9,0`]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}

    if x > 10 and y > 10:
        if not 'step 1 is True\\n' in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Hmm, step 1 is True, but you didn't print it."

        if 'step 1 is True\\n' in _output:
            status['done'] = False
            status['message'] = "Hmm, step 1 should be False"
    if z > x or y > x:
