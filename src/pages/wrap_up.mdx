# Wrap Up

We have covered a lot of content in this course.
There is a lot more to learn about Python,
but this has given you a good foundation to build on.

But before we go, here are some exercises to practice what you have learned.

## Exercises

Complete the following exercises, feel free to go back and review the content if you need to.

### Lots of groceries

A group of friends is carrying a bag of groceries each. Who is carrying the most weight? Print `{name} is carrying the most with {weight} pounds`
for the person with the most weight.

<Exercise src="wrap_up/lots-of-groceries" />

### Even more groceries

Unfortunately, the friends are carrying more groceries than they can handle.
Given the list of grocery weights, print the maximum number of groceries
the friends can carry if they can carry `1000` pounds.

### Red, Green, and Blue

A class of students is playing a game.
They are sitting in a circle and have cards with the colors red, green, and blue on them.
During each round, the students switch their cards
to a different color based on the color the student to their left and right have.

Each student follows only the first rule that applies to them. Here are the rules:

1. If both the students to the left and right have the same card,
   the student keeps their current card.
2. If the student to the left has a different card than the student,
   the student switches to that card.
3. The student switches to the card of the student to the right.

After `10` rounds, print the number of students with each color card on each line as follows:

```
red: 10
green: 7
blue: 4
```

Note: The students all switch their cards at the same time.

## What's Next?

There are a lot of resources available to learn more about Python.

- [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) - A free book that covers the basics of Python, in a very readable format.
  This course is structured similarly to this book.
- [Python For Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) - The official
  Python beginners guide will help you get started with
  installing Python on your computer and has links to many other resources and tutorials.
- [Python Discord](https://docs.python.org/3/) - Join the Python Discord server to ask questions and get help from other Python developers.
- [Local User Groups](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups) - Join a local Python user group to meet other Python developers in your area.
