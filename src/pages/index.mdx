# Learn Python - Interactive Course

Welcome! This interactive course will teach you Python programming from the ground up, with no installation required.

## Why should I learn Python?

According to the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) Python is the
most widely used programming language right now. It also happens to be one of
the simpler languages to learn. Python is also a versatile language that is
free and open source. It's a great option to learn for both beginners and experienced
programmers. Python is used in many fields for web applications, data analysis, machine learning, and task automation.
Learning Python will give you a solid foundation for learning other languages,
enable you to solve personal computer tasks, and provide in-demand skills.

## How is the course different?

This course simplifies the process of learning Python. Thanks
to [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) all you need to run Python
is a browser. The same editor that powers the popular
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is also included for each exercise.
So we can get right to what you are here for, to learn Python!

This course is completely free and ad-free.

## What will I learn?

The objective of this course is to get you up and
running with Python quickly. You will solve real problems in
interactive exercises to reinforce learning the fundamentals of Python.
The lessons will be concise and focused on teaching what is required to
complete the next exercise.
