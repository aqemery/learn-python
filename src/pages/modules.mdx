# Modules

A module is a collection of python code that can be imported for use in your code. When
a module is imported, the code in the module is executed, which makes it possible to use the
functions and variables defined in the module. Python includes several modules in
its standard library and you can also create and install more.
In this section, we will sample a few of the standard library modules
so you can get a feel for how modules work.


<Heading level={2} id="import" />
## Importing modules{{ anchor: false }}

We will be using the `sys` module in this section as an example.
The `sys` module provides access to some variables
such as the python version and the current platform the code is running on.

To use a module, you must first import it.
You can import a module using the `import` keyword. After importing a module, you can access its functions and variables by using the dot operator.
For example, to print the current python version, you can do the following:

```python
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

If you only want to use a specific function or variable from a module, you can import it directly using
the `from` keyword.

```python
from sys import version
```

And if you want to import multiple functions or variables from a module, you can do the following:

```python
from sys import version, platform
```

You can even change the name of what you are importing.

```python
import sys as system
from sys import version as python_version
from sys import version, platform as sys_version, sys_platform
```

### Exercise

Use the `sys` module to print the current python version and platform.

<PyEditor
  title='Import exercise'
  defaultCode={``}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}

    import sys

    joined_out = ' '.join(_output)
    if not f'{sys.version}' in joined_out:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you print the version?"

    if not f'{sys.platform}' in joined_out:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you print the platform?"

    status
`}
/>

<Heading level={2} id="random" />
## The `random` module {{ anchor: false }}

The `random` module provides functions for generating
random numbers amount other things. The `randint`
function imported from a module. The `randint` function
takes two integers as arguments and will return a random integer
between the two numbers. For example, the following code will print
a random number between 1 and 100, including 1 and 100.

```python
from random import randint
print(randint(1, 100))
```

### Exercise

Using `randint` create a random number `x` from 1 to 4. Then, print the number as a word.
For example, if the number is 1, print `one`.

<PyEditor
  title='Random exercise'
  defaultCode={``}
  preRunCode={`
    x = None
  `}
  preValidation = {[
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``
  ]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}

    if x is None:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you create a random number named 'x'?"
    else:
      _names =['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
      if not f'{_names[x-1]}\\n' in _output:
          status['done'] = False
          status['message'] = f"hmm, did you print the number as a word?"

    status
`}
/>


<Heading level={2} id="math" />
## The `math` module{{ anchor: false }}

The `math` module is another useful module to know.
It provides access to many mathematical functions and constants
that you would find on a calculator. Such as `math.pi`.

```python
import math
print(math.pi)
```

### Exercise

Using the `math` modules `sqrt` function, print the square root of `90`.

<PyEditor
  title='Math exercise'
  defaultCode={``}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}

    import math

    joined_out = ' '.join(_output)
    if not f'{math.sqrt(90)}' in joined_out:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you print the square root of 90?"

    status
`}
/>


<Heading level={2} id="os" />
## The `os` module {{ anchor: false }}

The `os` module provides access to functions
that allow you to interact with the operating system,
like working with files and directories.
Another feature is the ability to read environment variables
set by the operating system.

```python
import os
print(os.getenv("PATH"))
```

### Exercise

Using the `os` module, print the environment variables of the `HOME` directory

<PyEditor
  title='OS exercise'
  defaultCode={``}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}

    import os
    joined_out = ' '.join(_output)
    if not os.getenv("HOME") in joined_out:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you print the HOME directory?"

    status
`}
/>
