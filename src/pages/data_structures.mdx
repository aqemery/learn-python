# Data Structures

A data structure is a way to store data. Different data structures are used for different tasks.
In this lesson, we will learn the core data structures in Python.

<Heading level={2} id="list" />
## List {{ anchor: false }}

A `list` is a data structure that stores ordered data. It also allows you to add and remove data, as well as sort the data.
Here is an example of a list containing integers:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
```

Here are some basic operations you can do with a `list`:

```python
numbers = [3, 5, 2]
numbers.append(4) # [3, 5, 2, 4]
numbers.remove(2) # [3, 5, 4]
numbers.sort() # [3, 4, 5]
```

### Exercise

Use list methods to:
1. Create a list named `numbers` with the numbers `4`, `5`, and `6`
2. Given a list named `hidden`, add `5`, remove `2`, and then sort.

<PyEditor
  title='List Methods Exercise'
  defaultCode=''
  preRunCode = {`
import random
hidden = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(3)]
hidden.append(2)
_hidden = hidden.copy()
`}
validation = {`
status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice Job!"}
_hidden.append(5)
_hidden.remove(2)
_hidden.sort() 

if not numbers == [4,5,6]:
  status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, not seeing the correct value for numbers"}

elif not hidden == _hidden:
  status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, not seeing the correct value for hidden"}
status
`}
checkCode = { (code) => {  
}}

/>



<Heading level={2} id="tuple" />
## Tuple {{ anchor: false }}

A `list` is a data structure that stores ordered data. It also allows you to add and remove data, as well as sort the data.
Here is an example of a list containing integers:


A `tuple` is similar to a `list`, but it is immutable or unchangeable. Here is an example of a tuple
containing integers:

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
```

This may look familiar to you because function arguments are passed as tuples. Also, if you `return`
multiple values from a function, they are returned as a tuple.


```python
def add_and_subtract(a, b):
    return a + b, a - b

result = add_and_subtract(1, 2)
print(result) # (3, -1)
```

If you need to modify a tuple, you can convert it to a list, then modify it.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
numbers = list(numbers)
numbers.append(4)
print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```


<Heading level={2} id="sequence" />
## Sequence {{ anchor: false }}

`list` and `tuple` are both sequences, even strings are sequences.
A sequence is an ordered collection of items that can be accessed by index.
There are several operations you can do with a sequence.

### Indexing

A data element in a sequence can be accessed by its index. The first element in a sequence has an index of `0`.

```python
letters = "hello"
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
other_numbers = (4, 5, 6)

print(letters[0]) # h
print(numbers[0]) # 1
print(other_numbers[0]) # 4

print(letters[1]) # e
print(numbers[1]) # 2
print(other_numbers[1]) # 5
```

Python also has support for negative indexing, which allow you to access elements from the end of the sequence.

```python
letters = "hello"
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
other_numbers = (4, 5, 6)

print(letters[-1]) # o
print(numbers[-1]) # 3
print(other_numbers[-1]) # 6

print(letters[-2]) # l
print(numbers[-2]) # 2
print(other_numbers[-2]) # 5
```

### Slicing

You can also use indexing to create a new sequence from a subset of the original sequence. This is called slicing.

```python
letters = "hello"
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
other_numbers = (4, 5, 6)

print(letters[1:3]) # el
print(numbers[1:3]) # [2, 3]
print(other_numbers[1:3]) # (5, 6)
```

You don't have to specify the start or end of the slice. If you don't specify the start, it will start at the beginning of the sequence.
If you don't specify the end, it will go to the end of the sequence.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(numbers[:2]) # [1, 2]
print(numbers[1:]) # [2, 3]
```

### Iterating

Iterating is the process of going through each element in a sequence. You can do this with a `for` `in` loop.

```python
letters = "hello"
for letter in letters:
  if letter == "l":
    print("found l")
```

In the example above, the variable `letter` is assigned for each iteration of the loop and can be used to access the current element in the sequence.
We can then run specific code for each element in the sequence.

### Concatenation

You can also combine two sequences using the `+` operator. We can see this with strings already, but it also works with lists and tuples.

```python
letters = "hello"
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
other_numbers = (4, 5, 6)

print(letters + ' there!') # hello there!
print(numbers + [4,5]) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(other_numbers + (1, 2)) # (4, 5, 6, 1, 2)
```

Concatenation only works with sequences of the same type. You cannot combine a `list` and a `tuple`.

### The `in` Operator

You can also check if an element is in a sequence using the `in` operator.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(1 in numbers) # True
print(4 in numbers) # False
```

### The `len` Function

You can also get the length of a sequence using the `len` function.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(len(numbers)) # 3
```

### Sequence Unpacking and Assignment

You can also assign multiple variables at once using sequence unpacking.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
a, b, c = numbers
print(a) # 1
print(b) # 2
print(c) # 3
```

You don't have to assign all the values in the sequence. You can use the `_` character to ignore values and the
`*` character to capture the rest of the values.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a, _, *b = numbers
print(a) # 1
print(b) # [3, 4, 5]
```

### Exercise

Given a sequence `numbers` print the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of the sequence. Note: your solution should work if the sequence is a `list` or `tuple`.


<PyEditor
  title='Sequence Exercise'
  defaultCode='print(numbers)'
  preRunCode = {`
    import random
    numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(random.randint(7, 14))]
    _numbers = numbers.copy()
    if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:
      numbers = tuple(numbers)
`}

preValidation = {[
    `import random; numbers = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(7)]; _numbers = list(numbers)`,
    `import random; numbers = tuple(random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(8)); _numbers = list(numbers)`
  ]}
validation = {`
  status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice Job!"}
  import statistics
  if not f"{statistics.median(_numbers)}\\n" in _output:
    if len(_numbers) % 2 == 0:
      status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, that doesn't look right for even length sequences"}
    else:
      status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, that doesn't look right"}
  status
`}
/>

<Heading level={2} id="set" />
## Set {{ anchor: false }}

A `set` is a data structure that stores unordered data.
It also allows you to add and remove data, as well as check if data is in the set.
You can create a set using the `set` function or by using curly braces. However, you will need
to use the `set` function if you want to create an empty set or if you want to create a set from a sequence.

```python
numbers = set([1, 2, 3])
print(numbers) # {1, 2, 3}

letters = {"a", "b", "c"}
print(letters) # {"a", "b", "c"}
```

A `set` can only contain unique values. If you try to add a value that is already in the set, it will be ignored.

```python
numbers = set([1, 2, 3])
numbers.add(1)
print(numbers) # {1, 2, 3}
```

Here are some basic operations you can do with a `set`:

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
numbers.add(4) # {1, 2, 3, 4}
numbers.remove(2) # {1, 3, 4} error if 2 is not in the set
numbers.discard(4) # {1, 3} does not error if 4 is not in the set
numbers.clear() # {}
```

Sets are unordered, so you cannot access a specific value in a set.
However, several of the same operations that work for sequences also work for sets.

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
print(len(numbers)) # get the length 
print(1 in numbers) # check if a value is in the set
for number in numbers: # iterate over the set
  print(number)
```

Sets also have some useful operations that can be used on multiple sets.

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3}
other_numbers = {3, 4, 5}
print(numbers | other_numbers) # union {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(numbers & other_numbers) # intersection {3}
print(numbers - other_numbers) # difference {1, 2}
print(numbers ^ other_numbers) # symmetric difference {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

### Exercise

Given a list `to_remove` create a new set called `numbers` that contains the all
numbers 1 through 10 that are not in `to_remove`.

<PyEditor
  title='Set Exercise'
  defaultCode='print(to_remove)
  numbers = set()'
  preRunCode = {`
    import random
    to_remove = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(3)]`
  }
  preValidation = {[
    `import random; to_remove = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(3)]; _to_remove = list(to_remove)`,
    `import random; to_remove = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(3)]; _to_remove = list(to_remove)`,
    `import random; to_remove = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(3)]; _to_remove = list(to_remove)`,
  ]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice Job!"}
    try:
      if not numbers == {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} - set(_to_remove):
        status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, that doesn't look right"}
    except NameError:
      status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, you didn't create a variable called numbers"}
    status
  `}
/>








<Heading level={2} id="dictionary" />
## Dictionary {{ anchor: false }}

A `dictionary` is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. You can create a dictionary
using the `dict` function or by using curly braces.

```python
letters = {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c"}
print(letters) # {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c"}

numbers = dict([(1, "one"), (2, "two"), (3, "three")])
print(numbers) # {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}

empty = {} # empty dictionary not empty set
```

A `dictionary` can only contain unique keys, this is similar to a `set`. However,
the values in a dictionary can be repeated.

```python
numbers = {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "b" 1: "c"}
print(numbers) # {1: "c", 2: "b", 3: "b"}
```

You can access the value of a key in a dictionary using square brackets. This is similar to an index in a list,
but you use the key instead of the index.

```python
numbers = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
print(numbers[1]) # "one"
```

Similarly, you can use square brackets to change or add a value by key.

```python
numbers = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
numbers[1] = "ONE"
numbers[4] = "four"
print(numbers) # {1: "ONE", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four"}
```

Using the `in` operator will check if a key is in the dictionary.

```python
numbers = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
print(1 in numbers) # True
print(4 in numbers) # False
```

If you want to check if a value is in the dictionary, you can use the `values` method.

```python
numbers = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
print("one" in numbers.values()) # True
print("four" in numbers.values()) # False
```

The `len` works similarly to a list, but it will return the number of keys in the dictionary.

You can use the `keys` method to iterate over the keys in a dictionary or
the `values` method to iterate over the values. However, the `items` method will give you both the key and value.

```python
numbers = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}
for key, value in numbers.items():
  print(key, value)
# 1 one
# 2 two
# 3 three
```

### Exercise

Given a list `numbers` create a dictionary called `counts` that contains
the number of times each number appears in the list.

<PyEditor
  title='Dictionary Exercise'
  defaultCode='print(numbers)
  counts = {}'
  preRunCode = {`
    import random
    numbers = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(100)]`
  }
  preValidation = {[
    `import random; numbers = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(100)]; _numbers = list(numbers)`,
    `import random; numbers = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(100)]; _numbers = list(numbers)`,
    `import random; numbers = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(100)]; _numbers = list(numbers)`,
  ]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice Job!"}
    try:
      if not counts == {number: _numbers.count(number) for number in _numbers}:
        status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, that doesn't look right"}
    except NameError:
      status = {"done": False, "message": "hmm, you didn't create a variable called counts"}
    status
  `}
/>
