# Introduction

Welcome! My name is Adam Emery. I am a full stack developer who has used python
for many years.

## Why should I learn Python? {{ anchor: false }}

According to the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) Python is the
most widely used programming language right now. It also happens to be one of
the simpler languages to learn. Python is also a versatile language that is
free and open source. It’s a great option to learn for both beginners.

## How is the course different?  {{ anchor: false }}

This course simplifies the process of learning Python. Thanks
to [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) all you need to run Python
is a browser. The same editor that powers the popular
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is also included for each exercise. 
So we can get right to what you are here for, to learn Python!


<Heading level={2} id="what-will-I-learn" />
## What will I learn? {{ anchor: false }}

The objective of this course is to get you up and
running with python quickly. You will solve real problems in
interactive exercises to reinforce learning the fundamentals of python.
The lesson will be concise and focused on teaching what is required to
complete the next exercise. You will also learn how to `help()` yourself.

    In this example, we request the page that starts after the conversation with id `s4WycXedwhQrEFuM`. As a result, we get a list of three conversations and can tell by the `has_more` attribute that we have reached the end of the resultset.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="starting_after" type="string">
        The last ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the next page.
      </Property>
      <Property name="ending_before" type="string">
        The first ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the previous page.
      </Property>
      <Property name="limit" type="integer">
        Limit the number of items returned.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error — this means it's a _you_
    problem.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error — you won't be seeing these.

    Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the Protocol API will return an error response with an error type and message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

    Here is a list of the two error types supported by the Protocol API — use these to understand what you have done wrong.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="api_error">
        This means that we made an error, which is highly speculative and unlikely.
      </Property>
      <Property name="invalid_request">
        This means that you made an error, which is much more likely.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

    ```bash {{ title: "Error response" }}
    {
      "type": "api_error",
      "message": "No way this is happening!?",
      "documentation_url": "https://protocol.chat/docs/errors/api_error"
