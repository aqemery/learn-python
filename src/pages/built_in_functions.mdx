# Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions that you can use. These functions are available without importing any modules.
In this lesson, we will learn about a few of them. You can see a full list of built-in functions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

## Numbers

There are several functions available for working with numbers and lists of numbers. These include:

- `abs()` - returns the absolute value of a number
- `round()` - rounds a number to a given number of decimals
- `divmod()` - returns both `//` and `%` in a single operation

```python
abs(-5) # 5
round(3.14159) # 3
round(3.14159, 2) # 3.14
divmod(10, 3) # (3, 1)
```

Functions that take a list of numbers as an argument include:

- `min()` - returns the smallest number in a list
- `max()` - returns the largest number in a list
- `sum()` - returns the sum of all numbers in a list

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
min(x) # 1
max(x) # 3
sum(x) # 6
```
## Characters

The `ord()` and `chr()` functions allow you to convert a character to and from its Unicode code integer representation.

```python
ord('a') # 97
chr(97) # 'a'
```
## Booleans

The `any()` and `all()` functions are used to evaluate a list of booleans. Each item in the list
is evaluated as a boolean, equivalent to `bool()` function.



```python
bool(0) # False
bool(1) # True
bool('') # False
bool('a') # True

any([True, False, False]) # True
any([False, False, False]) # False
any([1, 0, 0]) # True
any([0, 0, 0]) # False
any(['a', '', '']) # True
any(['', '', '']) # False

all([True, False, False]) # False
all([True, True, True]) # True
all([1, 0, 0]) # False
all([1, 1, 1]) # True
all(['a', '', '']) # False
all(['a', 'a', 'a']) # True
```
## Sequences

Several functions can be used to work with sequences. `sorted()` and `reversed()`
return a new list with a changed order. The original list is not modified.

```python
x = [3, 1, 2]
sorted(x) # [1, 2, 3]
reversed(x) # [2, 1, 3]
```

The `enumerate()` function is used to iterate over a sequence when you need both the index and the value.

```python
x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'b', 'a']
for i, v in enumerate(x):
    print(i, v) 
    if i != 0 and v == x[i-1]:
        print("two of the same value in a row")

# 0 a
# 1 b
# 2 c
# 3 c
# two of the same value in a row
# 4 b
# 5 a
```

The `zip()` function is used to iterate over multiple sequences at the same time.

```python
x = ['a', 'b', 'c']
y = [1, 2, 3]
for i, j in zip(x, y):
    print(i, j)

# a 1
# b 2
# c 3
```

The `map()` function is used to apply a function to each item in a sequence.

```python
x = ["1", "2", "3"]
y = list(map(int , x)) # [1, 2, 3]
```


## Exercise

Given two lists of numbers called `secret` and `key`, use the following steps to decode the message.

1. Get the absolute value of each number in `secret`
2. For each index add the number in `key` to the result of step 1
3. Reverse the order of the numbers in the result of step 2
4. Use integer division to divide each number in the result of step 3 by `5`
5. Add the index of each number in step 4 to its value
6. Convert each value to a character
7. use `''.join(list)` to convert a list of characters to a string
