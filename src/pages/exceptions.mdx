# Exceptions

An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. 
When an exception occurs, the program stops and an error message is displayed.
You have likely seen some exceptions already in the previous lessons.
For example, if you try to divide a number by zero,
you will get a ZeroDivisionError exception. Try it out in the editor below:


<Exercise src="exceptions/exception-example" />

## Common Exception Types

There are several built-in exceptions in Python. Here are some of the most common ones:

### IndentationError

Occurs when there is a problem with the indentation of your code. 

```python
# IndentationError: unexpected indent
x = 5
y = 6
 z = x + y

# IndentationError: expected an indented block
if x > 5:
print("x is greater than 5")
```

### ValueError

A `ValueError` occurs when a function receives a bad argument.
For example, The Int function can convert a string to an integer,
but only if the string contains a valid integer.

```python
y = int("24") # y = 24
x = int("hello") # ValueError
```

### TypeError 

A `TypeError` occurs when an operation is performed 
between two incompatible types, but it can also
occur when calling a function with the wrong
number of arguments.

```python
# TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
x = "hello" + 5

# TypeError: too many arguments
int(1,2,3) 
```

### NameError

A `NameError` occurs when you use a variable
that doesn't exist.

```python
print(x) # NameError
```

### IndexError

An `IndexError` occurs when you try to get
the index of a sequence that is out of range.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
x[5] # IndexError
```

### KeyError

A `KeyError` occurs when you try to get a
value in a dictionary using a key that doesn't exist.

```python
x = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
x["c"] # KeyError
```

## Handling Exceptions

Often you will want your program to continue to run in spite
of an exception. 

The `try` and `except` are used to handle exceptions.
Which means doing something when an exception occurs.

```python
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("x is not defined")
``` 

In the example above, we try to print the variable `x`, but
it doesn't exist, so we get a `NameError`.
However, since the print statement is inside a `try` block,
the program does not crash and instead prints "x is not defined".

In this example, we did not specify which exception to handle.
This means that the except block will handle any type of exception.
It is however best practice to specify which exception to handle.

```python
try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("x is not defined")
```

`try` blocks function like if statements, in that you can have additional
`except` blocks to handle different exceptions, and an `else` block if
no exception occurs, and a `finally` block always executes when
the `try` block is finished.

```python
try:
    print(x)
    5/0
except NameError:
    print("x is not defined")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero")
except:
    print("Something else went wrong")
else:
    print("Nothing went wrong")
finally:
    print("The 'try except' is finished")
```

### Getting the exception

You may want to do something with the exception object,
like printing the error message. You can use `as` keyword,
to assign the exception object to a variable. Then you can
access the exception object's properties and methods, such
as its message.

```python
try:
    print(x)
except NameError as e:
    print(e.message)
```

### Exercise

Add error handling to the functions below. When an error occurs, return the error type.
