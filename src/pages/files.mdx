# Basics

Welcome! I am glad you are here, and I hope you are excited to learn Python. 
In this lesson, we will cover the basics of data types and variables.




## Creating Files {{ anchor: false }}

The `os` module provides functions for reading and writing files.
To read or write to a file, you must first open it.
The `open` function is used to open a file.

```python
file = open('file.txt', 'w')
```

The `open` function takes two arguments, the name of the file and the mode.
Several modes can be used when opening a file, such as: `r` for reading, `w` for writing, and `a` for appending.
We can then use the `write` method to write to the file.
It is also important to close the file when you are
done using it, or your changes may not be saved.

```python
file = open('file.txt', 'w')
file.write('hello world')
file.close()
```

It is recommended that you use the `with open` syntax when
opening a file as this will close the file for you.

```python
with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('hello world')
```

Reading from a file is similar to writing a file.
The `open` function is used to open a file.

```python
with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.read()
```

You can read and write to a file at the same time using the `r+` mode.


### Exercise

Use the `os` module to:
1. Create a file named `file.txt` and write `hello world!` to it.
2. Read the contents of the `note.txt` file and print it.

<PyEditor
  title='file exercise'
  defaultCode={``}
  preRunCode={`
    import os
    with open('note.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write('Hello there! I hope you are having a great day!')
  `}
  preValidation = {[
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``,
    ``
  ]}
  validation = {`
    status = {"done": True, "message": "Nice job!"}

    import os

    if not os.path.exists('file.txt'):
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you create a file named 'file.txt'?"

    if not os.path.exists('note.txt'):
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you create a file named 'note.txt'?"

    joined_out = ' '.join(_output)
    if not f'hello world!' in joined_out:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you write 'hello world!' to the file?"

    if not f'hello world!' in joined_out:
        status['done'] = False
        status['message'] = "hmm, did you read the contents of the file?"

    status
`}
/>
