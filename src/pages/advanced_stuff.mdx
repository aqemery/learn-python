If you try to add a string and an integer together, you will get an error.

```python
>>> 1 + "test"
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

>>> "test" + 1
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

Something is interesting here! The error messages are different. This is because the `+` operator
is a shortcut for the `__add__` method of the first operand's type. Lets take a quick peek under the hood.

<PyEditor
  title='Under the hood'
  defaultCode='help(int.__add__)
  print(1.5.__add__(1))
  
  x = 1
  print(x.__add__(1))

  print("hello".__add__(1))'
/>

It certainly is easier to just use the `+` operator!

## Binary Numbers {{ anchor: false }}

Binary numbers are numbers that are represented using only the digits `0` and `1`.
Binary numbers are used in computers because they are easy to represent using electricity.
In Python, we can use the `bin` function to convert a number to binary.

```python
print(bin(5)) # 0b101
```
