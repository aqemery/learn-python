# Classes

A class is a data structure that contains attributes and methods.
You have already used classes in Python. For example, `int` and `list` are both classes.

```python
print(int) # <class 'int'>
print(list) # <class 'list'>
```

In the `list` class the attribute is the data stored in the list and
the methods are functions that can be called on the list, 
such as `append` and `sort`.

A class instance is an object that is created from a class. Using `int` as an example,
`1` and `5` would be instances of the `int` class. 

We can use the built-in function `isinstance` to check if an object is an instance of a class.
Similarly, we can use the built-in function `type` to get the class of an object.

```python
isinstance(5, int) # True
isinstance(5, list) # False
print(type(5)) # <class 'int'>
```

## Creating a class

The keyword `class` is used to create a class.

```python
class ClassDefinition:
    attribute = 10
    def method():
        return 20

print(ClassDefinition.attribute) # 10
print(ClassDefinition.method()) # 20
```

### Creating an instance

A class instance is an object that is created from a class.
The `self` argument is automatically passed into instance methods
when the method is called. It can be used
to access the attributes and methods of the object.

```python
class ClassDefinition:
    attribute = 10
    def method(self):
        return self.attribute * 2

# use the class to create an object
class_instance = ClassDefinition()
print(class_instance.attribute) # 10
print(class_instance.method()) # 20
```

## The `__init__` method

Dunder methods are special methods that are used to define the behavior of a class.
The `__init__` dunder method is one of these special methods. It is called when an object
is created from a class to initialize the object with any attributes that are required.

```python
class ClassDefinition:
    def __init__(self, attribute):
        self.attribute = attribute

    def method(self):
        return self.attribute * 2

# use the class to create an object
class_instance = ClassDefinition(20)
print(class_instance.attribute) # 20
print(class_instance.method()) # 40
```

## Exercise

1. Create a class called `Person`
2. Add two attributes: `name` and `age` that can be set when the object is created.
3. Create a method called `introduce` that prints a string in the format: 

`Hi, My name is Joe and I am 12 years old.`
